  <h3>Academic Career</h3>
  <p>After a decade of searching for that elusive "perfect" career field, I can honestly
    say I'm happy with my decision to go into Information Technology.
    I've dabbled in almost every major imaginable, from
    veterinary medicine to electrical engineering. At one point
    I felt like the Goldilocks of academic majors: "This one has too much math!"
    or "This one takes too long!". The ITM program at IIT turned out
    to be fun and the campus is close to Reggie's, one of my favorite rock bars.
    I can tell that students and faculty alike have a strong passion for anything tech.
    That impressed me the most.</p>

  <h3>Academic Achievements</h3>
    <p>I rocked my first year here as a transfer not only by being selected as a Featured
    ITM Student for the official IIT website, but also by winning a scholarship to the Women in Cyber Security Conference in
    Arizona, by designing and building a Smart Mirror that gained a decent amount of exposure, and
    landing a badass internship at the Exelon Power Plant in Morris, IL.
    So logically, if IIT thinks I'm that cool, imagine how much I would kick ass at your company.

    <h3>A Blurb on What I Think is Fun</h3>
    <p>I love longboarding (especially in California), the weirder the music the better, I seem to meet a lot of famous musicians after shows, I believe street art is classy, I could not live without Siberian Huskies, I love to nerd out on building or fixing computers,
      existential conversations are my bread and butter, Vikings and beards are the cats pajamas, and good wine or craft beer is an essential in my fridge.</p>
