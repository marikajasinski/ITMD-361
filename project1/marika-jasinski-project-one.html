  <h1>Marika Jasinski's Portfolio</h1>
  <h2>Senior at the Illinois Institute of Technology</h2>
  <h3>Information Technology and Management Major</h3>
  <h4>Specialization: Cyber Security and Forensics<h4>

  <p>After more than a decade of searching for the right career field, I think I'm
    finally where I belong. I have gone through several different programs, from
    veterinary medicine to electrical engineering. At one point,
    I felt like the Goldilocks of academic majors ("This one has too much math!"
    or "This one takes too long!").
    I chose the ITM program at the Illinois Institute of Technology
    because both my mom and dad are alumni,
    the school offered me a substantial scholarship package, and it seemed
    like a neat program in general.
    Most of the classes are interesting and are good at keeping my attention (which
    is no small feat since I have the attention span of a crow).
    I'm ready to graduate with a solid toolbox of tech skills and to start my IT career
    at a successful tech company(Hiya, Google!)
    While you're here, take a gander at my resume or check out
    some of the awesome projects I've worked on here at IIT.
    Thanks!</p>
